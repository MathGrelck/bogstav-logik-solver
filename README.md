# bogstav-logik-solver
Solves the "bogstav logik" cross-word mini-game. During my vacation I stumbled upon this type of mini game in a sunday cross-words magazine, and due to the frustration of not being able to solve one of them, I decided to create this brute-force solver in Python. 

Run with

```
python bogstav-logik-solver.py puzzles/qXX.txt
```
